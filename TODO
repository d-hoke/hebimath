Integer Functions:

* zpopcount
* zhamdist
* zscan0
* zscan1
* ztrunc
* zand
* zor
* zxor
* znot
* zgetstrlen/zsizeinbase

Other:

* add a special invalid allocator id value for zinit_buffer functions
* consider making pmul return normalized length, and remove zeroing
  of bytes if length is null, would give small boost to karatsuba which
  has already zeroed destination memory
* add support for GCC/Clang overflow intrinsics when checking if
  memory allocation sizes exceed max size
