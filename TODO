Integer Functions:

* zpopcount
* zhamdist
* zscan0
* zscan1
* ztrunc
* zand
* zor
* zxor
* znot
* zgetstrlen/zsizeinbase

Other:

* make use of C11 static assert on user configuration values
* add a special invalid allocator id value for zinit_buffer functions
* consider making pmul return normalized length, and remove zeroing
  of bytes if length is null, would give small boost to karatsuba which
  has already zeroed destination memory
* consider creating an ASSERT macro to wrap assert, and add assertions
  to low-level functions
