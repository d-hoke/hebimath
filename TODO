Low-level Functions:

* add/sub variants for inplace operations and same-sized inputs
* port remainder of division implementation to x86-64 assembly

Integer Functions:

* zpopcount
* zhamdist
* zscan0
* zscan1
* zgetstrlen/zsizeinbase
* zgcd
* zpowu

Optimize:
* zand
* zor
* zxor
* znot
* ztrunc
* pandmsk__

Other:

* add a special invalid allocator id value for zinit_buffer functions
* consider making pmul return normalized length, and remove zeroing
  of bytes if length is null, would give small boost to karatsuba which
  has already zeroed destination memory
* add support for GCC/Clang overflow intrinsics when checking if
  memory allocation sizes exceed max size
* optimize kernel functions for input constraints (non-zero sizes)
* optimize use of ptest/vptest instruction by speculatively executing
  instructions in between test and branch
