Low-level Functions:

* add/sub variants for inplace operations and same-sized inputs
* port remainder of division implementation to x86-64 assembly
* optimize pclz, almost always called on normalized input
* move most of zsetstr into psetstr backend?

Integer Functions:

* zhamdist
* zpopcount
* zscan0
* zscan1
* zsetbit
* zgcd
* zpowu
* zsqrt

Optimize:

* znot
* ztrunc
* pandmsk__
* pclz

Other:

* create some sample programs
* add a lot more checks/tests
* add hebi_kiss init/destroy functions
* add additional random number generators
* test and fix bugs in ztrunc
* improve zand, zor and zxor to generate correct results for negative numbers
* add a special invalid allocator id value for zinit_buffer functions
* add support for compiler static analysis
* add support for SEI CERT C validation and perform security audit
* perform an audit on floating-point values, make sure we aren't using any
  except for when we need to convert to/from these data types
* code cleanup audit, remove any C++ style comments, C++ style pointer
  declarations, trailing whitespace, convert spaces to tabs, etc.
