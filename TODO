Low-level Functions:

* add/sub variants for inplace operations and same-sized inputs
* port remainder of division implementation to x86-64 assembly
* optimize pclz, almost always called on normalized input

Integer Functions:

* zhamdist
* zpopcount
* zscan0
* zscan1
* zsetbit
* zgcd
* zpowu
* zsqrt

Optimize:

* znot
* ztrunc
* pandmsk__

Other:

* add a special invalid allocator id value for zinit_buffer functions
* make sure can't allocate more than HEBI_PACKET_MAXLEN packets
* add support for GCC/Clang overflow intrinsics when checking if
  memory allocation sizes exceed max size
* fix memory leak with scratch memory due to TLS variables lacking
  destructor function
* cleanup use of USE_VALIDATION macro, do we even need this?
* add a lot more checks/tests
* create some sample programs
